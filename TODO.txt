 * Don't choke on doctypes
 * Iteration yields PyQuery objects, not lxml nodes
 * Uniformly support selectors (CSS3 + jQuery extensions)
 * Support the jQuery API more uniformly:
 * Pass a modified version of the Sizzle and/or jQuery test suite
 * Remove pyquery.ajax? It's rather outside the core purpose of this library. I'd rather have something focused on fluent DOM parsing than a swissarmy knife.



## Welp. Also.
