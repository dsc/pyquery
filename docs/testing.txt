Testing
-------

If you want to run the tests that you can see above you should do::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/olauzanne/pyquery/
    $ cd pyquery
    $ python bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout
    $ bin/test

You can build the Sphinx documentation by doing::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

If you don't already have lxml installed use this line::

    $ STATIC_DEPS=true bin/buildout
